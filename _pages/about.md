<h1> Who the f are you? </h1>

<p> As usual, I am not exactly sure what to write here. Sure, I'll give it a pop. I am an economist, so I tell myself anyway, with too much to say. Or sometimes not enough? I thought I would start a blog to have a place to share my ideas and thoughts with others. So there we are. </p>

<h2>Some things I have done:</h2>
<p> -MSc Economics (Queen's University of Belfast);<br>
-Dick Camplin Education Trust Scholar;<br>
-(precarious) Employment in startups and as a research assistant;<br>
-First generation university student;<br>
-Acquired a weird accent. </p>

<h2>Interests:</h2>
<p> -All things economics. More specifically, economic and social networks, platform/gig economy, inequality, alternative economic models/structures and class analysis; <br>
-Reading;<br>
-Electronic music (Sure if academia fails, I will have a sick music collection to rely on innit);<br>
-Doing a PhD in the future;<br>
-Attempting to teach myself French;<br>
-Also, learning Python;<br>
-Ah, that will do for now. </p>
