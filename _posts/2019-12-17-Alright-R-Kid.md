Expect a lot of changes whilst I get used to formatting the site, but the major ones should be all done. For now anyway. Looking not to shabby if you ask me.If something doesn't seem to be working or you have any suggestions, feel free to let me know. 

I will be aiming to try and post something at least every other day. Lucky you.
