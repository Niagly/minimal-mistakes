>If all the economists were laid end to end, they would not reach a conclusion
<cite>George Bernard Shaw</cite>

<h2>So why another blog to follow?</h2> 

<p>Are not there already thousands of other economists, academics, politicos and commentariat preaching their views on the internet and in the media? Clearly, yes. Although some of them are pretty good, I think there is something that is missing. Well, I think there are a few things which I will go into further below.</p>

<p>The first, in my opinion, is that here in the UK, there is a lack of regional viewpoints in our political and economic debates. You only have to look at who is speaking on the news or who is writing in the national press to see that regional voices under-represented. More specifically, those from working-class and minority backgrounds are cast aside in national debates, especially on topics that affect us the most. This needs to change and fast. </p> 
<p class="tab">From my own experience, this seems even more prevalent in academia. This is not because working class people are dumb or that we do not want to participate in laerning, but because it is hard to get our foot in the door or break down those barriers. Hopefully, starting this blog may help me break down some barriers and fingers crossed, it may even help others do the same.</p>

<p>Secondly, academics, bar a few gems, are primarily stuck in their bubble. We all know it. If we fail to make our work relatable to the everyday person on the street, we may change professions. Yet, this is not to say we should dumb our work down, the general population are not stupid, and we should not treat them as such, despite what many people think. So partly, I have started this blog to help hold myself to account regards this. It probably will not be easy at some points, but it has to be done.</p>

<p>Thirdly, I have never agreed with what is being taught throughout my economics journey. Not to say that we should not learn what has come before, but I think we can all agree too much emphasis is placed on mainstream economics. Economists go too far down the rabbit hole of these schools of thought, be it neoclassical or Keynesian for example, without looking where they are going. If we keep teaching and giving priority to theories that do not hold up to real-world scrutiny, we will keep on making the same mistakes. So, with this blog, I aim to highlight the need for alternative heterodox perspectives in economics.</p>

<p> On the back of pushing for more heterodox perspectives, as I am sure you are not surprised, I will be writing pieces from a heterodox economics angle. This is not a complete list, and a lot of this will overlap, but here is a little glimpse of some things to come.  For example, </p>

<ol>
  <li>Economic and social networks</li>
  <li>Socialist/Marxian economics</li>
  <li>Economic history</li>
  <li>Critiques of economic theory and pedagogy</li>
</ol>
<p> To name but a few. </p>


<p>I will probably add more when it is not 2am in the morning.</p>
 
<hr>
 
<p>Expect a lot of changes while I get used to formatting the site, but the major ones should be all done. For now, anyway. Looking not too shabby if you ask me. If something doesn't seem to be working or you have any suggestions, feel free to let me know. </p>

<p>I will also be aiming to try and post something at least every other day. See how it goes anyway. Till next time r'kid. </p>
