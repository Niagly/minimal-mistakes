>If all the economists were laid end to end, they would not reach a conclusion
<cite>George Bernard Shaw</cite>

<h2>So why another blog to follow?</h2> 

<p>Aren't there already thousands of other economists, academics and politicos preaching their views on the internet and in the media? Clearly, yes. Although some of them are pretty good, I think there is something that is missing. Well, I think there are a few things which I will go into further below.</p>

<p>The first, in my opinion, is that here in the UK there is a lack of regional viewpoints in our political and economic debates. You just have to look at the news or who is writing in the national press to see that we are under-represented. More specifically, those from working-class and minority backgrounds are cast mainly aside when we want to express our opinion. This needs to change and fast.</p> 
<p class="tab">From my own experiences, this seems even more prevalent in academia. This is not because we are dumb or that we do not want to participate, but because it is hard to get our foot in the door or break down those barriers. So hopefully, by starting this blog may help me break down some barriers, and help give me a leg up. Fingers crossed I can even help others do the same. There is a voice outside of the London sphere, and we need to be heard.</p>

<p>Secondly, academics, bar a few gems, are primarily stuck in their own bubble. We all know it. If we fail to make our work relatable to the everyday person, then we may as well change professions. Yet, this is not to say we should dumb our work down, the general population are not stupid, and we shouldn't treat them as such; despite what many people think. So partly I have started this blog to help hold myself to account regards this. It probably won't be easy at some points, but it is something that has to be done.</p>

<p>Thirdly, since my A-levels all the way through to my masters degree, I could never really agree with what we teach in economics. Not to say that we shouldn't learn what has come before, but I think we can all agree too much emphasis is placed on orthodox economics. Economists go too far down the rabbit hole of these schools of thought without looking where they are going. If we keep teaching and giving priority to theories which don't hold up to real-world scrutiny, then we will keep on making the same mistakes over and over again. So, with this blog, I aim to highlight the usefulness of having alternative perspectives in economics. Plus, I am a big raging leftie, imagine that ey, and our discipline definitely needs more left-leaning economists.</p>

<p>I will probably add more when it is not 2am in the morning.</p>

<p>Expect a lot of changes while I get used to formatting the site, but the major ones should be all done. For now, anyway. Looking not too shabby if you ask me. If something doesn't seem to be working or you have any suggestions, feel free to let me know. </p>

<p>I will also be aiming to try and post something at least every other day. Lucky you. See how it goes anyway. Till next time r'kid! </p>
